# v66

## New features

- Move low level API out to libsatiator, to be shared with other developers' apps: https://github.com/satiator/libsatiator
- Don't autoboot if an app has explicitly requested to reset to the Satiator menu using libsatiator

# v65

## New features

- Autobooting disc images. Files named autoboot.elf, autoboot.iso or autoboot.cue will be loaded automatically on startup, in that order of priority.
- Ability to boot ELF files directly without having to go through SEGA logo, et cetera. This leaves the Satiator in API mode, which may require adjustments to your code.
    Note that Jo Engine's "game.elf" is usually not an ELF file but instead a COFF; it can be converted by adding a rule like this to your makefile:

real.elf: game.elf
	# the actual conversion
	$(CONV) -O elf32-sh $< temporary.elf
	# ditch debug info and symbols for a much smaller file
	$(CONV) temporary.elf --strip-all $@

## Fixed

- Reading flash ID from Am29F010, Am29F010A found in certain AR carts is fixed

# v64

## New features

- Added a tools menu entry for diagnostic tools. Currently includes measuring SD card performance. Requires firmware 156.

# v63

## New features

- Added a tools menu entry for formatting the SD card. Requires firmware 155 or higher.

# v62

## Fixed

- When multiple controllers are connected, any of them can control the menu.
- Controls are changed to be closer to the Saturn design language:
    - D-pad left and right are page up/down
    - B is cancel
    - A and C are select
- Add a completion message to AR erase function

With thanks to ShadowofBob for the control & erase patches!

# v61

## New features

- Support for CUE/BIN/WAV images, with many thanks to lifning for the patch!

# v60

## New features

- Reset to menu on A+B+C+Start. This requires an AR cart running patched firmware 3, and Satiator firmware version 154.

## Fixed

- Fixed AR Flash detection for AT29C010A Flash chips, which needed a delay
- When backing up an AR cart, length was calculated wrong, and only the first half backed up
- Revert to requesting a BIOS clock change on startup; this causes flicker, but is the easiest way to get everything neat and tidy on an A+B+C+Start reset

## Known issues

- The VDP menu workaround which fixes the Croc missing head bug (amongst others) will not work after an A+B+C+Start reset.

# v59

## Fixed

- The region free patch in v58 caused booting to fail on some consoles; this
    has been fixed. The issue was that a boot variable is in two different places
    depending on BIOS version. I had assumed the split was across v1.00/v1.01 in
    the original patch. This new version checks directly where the variable
    actually is, ignoring the version, so it should work on all systems.

# v58

## Fixed

- Corrected region free booting to work with BIOS 1.00. As region-free is now
    always enabled, the previous code would just hang after fading out and before
    the SEGA logo.

# v57

## Improved

- Support AR carts with an SST 29LE020 flash chip. Weirdly, this is a 3.3V
    chip, but still appears in some carts.

# v56

## Improved

- Support AR carts that have older SST Flash chips. These do not respond to the
    JEDEC standard flash ID read command, which led to them not being recognised.

# v55

## Improved

- Avoid changing clock on startup; avoids a TV resync
- Messageboxes are less ugly and wrap text

# v54 2020-10-20

## Fixed

- Fix hang if pressing C on the main menu.

## Improved

- Action Replay writing is faster when less has changed.
- Some AR Flash chips are faster too.
- Provide better error messages if Flash can't be initialised.

# v53 2020-10-19

## Fixed

- Problems on exFAT-formatted SD cards caused by a lack of parent directory
    information.  This included not auto-booting when entering a folder with a
    single image, and an inability to move up directories in the hierarchy.

# v52 2020-10-19

## Added

- Action Replay support. Backup, reflash, and erase AR cartridges.
    Erasing the cartridge allows you to use it as a RAM expansion.
    To do this with a stock AR cart, remove the AR and boot into the
    Satiator menu before inserting the AR.

# v51 2020-09-22

## Added

- Satiator RTC support. Files are now stamped on the SD card according to the Saturn's RTC.
